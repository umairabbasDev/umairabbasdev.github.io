## Have you heard about the  **Splinternet** ?

It's a growing trend where governments and companies are making their own internet rules, leading to a divided online world. Some countries are even considering disconnecting from the global internet altogether, which could lead to even less free flow of information and ideas.

If your country were to block access to sites like Google, Twitter, and WhatsApp, would you still be able to operate your business or communicate with others effectively?

It's important to consider the potential impact of these developments and take action to protect yourself, such as creating your own software or using alternative communication channels.
